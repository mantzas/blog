My name is Sotirios Mantziaris (Greek: Σωτήρης Μαντζιάρης).  
I am a software engineer and live and work in Athens, Greece.

I work mostly in the Microsoft .Net Framework Stack but i am exploring everything interesting like [Go](https://golang.org/) lately.  
I consider myself mostly a back-end engineer, but i had my fair share of front end development in:

* Windows Desktop (WinForms, WPF) 	
* Web
	* Server Side ([Asp.NET WebForms](http://www.asp.net/web-forms), [Asp.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc))
	* Client Side ([Durandal](http://durandaljs.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/))
