Ramblings on Tasks, async-await and ASP.NET. The [slides](https://goo.gl/sO3ZGv) from the [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DotNetZone/events/231198572/)
 do contain common issues encountered when working with TPL, async-await and ASP.NET along with some good practices. These are off course not all. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks for attenting.
